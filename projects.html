		<ul>
			<li>During my free time, I designed and deployed my very first iOS app. I originally implemented my idea as a Java program however, I wanted a more efficient way to distribute the application. I spent the summer studying Xcode along with the Swift programming language in order to create a mobile version of my Java program. The app is a text-based adventure game where every scenario is randomly generated. I designed my algorithms to ensure that every play through would be equally unique and entertaining. The app is called Adventure Text and is available for download on the Apple App Store.
