		<ul>
			<li>During my free time, I designed and deployed my very first iOS app. I originally implemented my idea as a Java program however, I wanted a more efficient way to distribute the application. I spent the summer studying Xcode along with the Swift programming language in order to create a mobile version of my Java program. The app is a text-based adventure game where every scenario is randomly generated. I designed my algorithms to ensure that every play through would be equally unique and entertaining. The app is called Adventure Text and is available for download on the Apple App Store.

		<h2><a href="sim.html">C++ Particle Simulation</a></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>For my final project in my Computer Systems class, I implemented a fully functional particle simulator. Each particle would start at the same initial position on the 3-dimensional plane. The program would then randomly generate the necessary angles for the x-y-z components of the particle's initial velocity. Each particle would concurrently update its position to complete the various trajectory courses. Once the particles reached the set zero height on the plane, it would reflect its velocity to simulate a bounce. After a specified distance, each particle would disappear and reset at the center point to simulate a constant flow of water.
