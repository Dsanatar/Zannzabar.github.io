		<h1>Danny Sanatar</h1>

		<p>	I am an extremely motivated second-year undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor of Science, concentrated in Computer Science, and my minor in Mathematics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I possess exceptional experience in customer service along with analytical troubleshooting and excel in fast paced work environments. I am very familiar with a plethora of programming languages and am always eager to learn new ones in my spare time. I currently reside in Westchester New York, however I am more than willing to seek out temporary housing if needed. </p>
