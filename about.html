		<h1>Danny Sanatar</h1>

		<p>Hello! My name is Danny Sanatar and I am an extremely motivated third-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I was born and raised in Southern California and currently reside in Westchester New York. I am a deeply passionate programmer with proficiency in a wide variety of languages such as Java, C++, and Swift. Although most of my projects utilize those languages, I am constantly searching for new tools to build robust software. Outside of class, I am designing a project that utilizes the Spotify API and Node.js to display usersâ€™ current favorites based on frequency. Additionally, I have extensive experience working with iOS/Android Mobile App Development and Web Design, but ultimately love making applicable software for my friends and family.</p>
